use a relational database like [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) or a distributed NoSQL database such as [Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/_/index.html) for our requirements.

## API Design

Let's outline a basic API design for our services:

### Ride Request

This API allows customers to request a ride.

```tsx
requestRide(customerID: UUID, source: Tuple<float>, destination: Tuple<float>, cabType: Enum<string>, paymentMethod: Enum<string>): Ride
```

**Parameters**

Customer ID (`UUID`): Identifier for the customer.

Source (`Tuple<float>`): Coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the starting point.

Destination (`Tuple<float>`): Coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the endpoint.

**Returns**

Result (`Ride`): Details of the requested ride.

### Ride Cancellation

This API enables customers to cancel their ride.

```tsx
cancelRide(customerID: UUID, reason?: string): boolean
```

**Parameters**

Customer ID (`UUID`): Identifier for the customer.

Reason (`UUID`): Optional reason for canceling the ride.

**Returns**

Result (`boolean`): Indicates success or failure of the operation.

### Ride Acceptance or Denial

Drivers can use this API to accept or deny a ride request.

```tsx
acceptRide(driverID: UUID, rideID: UUID): boolean
denyRide(driverID: UUID, rideID: UUID): boolean
```

**Parameters**

Driver ID (`UUID`): Identifier for the driver.

Ride ID (`UUID`): Identifier for the requested ride.

**Returns**

Result (`boolean`): Indicates success or failure of the operation.

### Trip Management

This API lets drivers start or end a trip.

```tsx
startTrip(driverID: UUID, tripID: UUID): boolean
endTrip(driverID: UUID, tripID: UUID): boolean
```

**Parameters**

Driver ID (`UUID`): Identifier for the driver.

Trip ID (`UUID`): Identifier for the trip.

**Returns**

Result (`boolean`): Indicates success or failure of the operation.
